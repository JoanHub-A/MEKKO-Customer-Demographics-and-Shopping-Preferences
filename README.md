# Data Visualization With Excel
## The dashboard dives deep into customer base, shedding light on their demographics and shopping behaviors.
It's amazing to see how data can help us better understand our audience and tailor our strategies to meet their needs. Crafting this dashboard has not only allowed me to extract meaningful insights but also master the art of data visualization. Armed with these insights, stakeholders are better equipped to make informed decisions that resonate with customers. Presenting data in a visually engaging way is crucial for conveying complex information effectively. Whether it's refining marketing campaigns or optimizing product offerings, data-driven decisions are key.
MEKKO Retail Inc. is a global retail chain with multiple departments ranging from Books and Jewelry to Automotive. With its vast presence in different countries, it serves customers daily.

Case Overview:
As the company expands, itâ€™s becoming increasingly challenging for management to keep regular track of customer demographics, preferences, and other vital details that can help improve sales and customer satisfaction. The raw data makes it difficult to draw insights and make strategic decisions, leading to missed opportunities.

Analytics & Visualization:
I leveraged Excel to craft an interactive dashboard displaying:

Bulk of Customers Across Age Groups
Distribution of Customers in Selected Jobs Across Top 5 Departments
Top 5 Department Comparison Across Age Groups
Number of Visits Across Top 5 Departments
Customers' Car-Make Preference
Insights Uncovered:
Through thorough analysis of the raw dataset, it was revealed that:

The bulk of customers fall within the "17-27 years" age group.
Customers with vehicles other than Toyota and Ford are very minimal.
The distribution of customers in selected jobs across the top 5 store departments varies largely.
